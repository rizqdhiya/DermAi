We want to build a project that is beneficial for many people in the world and also for Indonesia. We believe that with this project we can help many people, especially in the health sector to provide anticipation when they are infected with symptoms of skin disease, so that it can help reduce the number of people affected by skin disease, especially in Indonesia. The application of the image recognition feature to recognize the symptoms of a skin disease really helps users to quickly find out what the disease is and how to prevent it as early as possible to avoid the disease.

Project Scope & Deliverables:
This Project will be focused On Users who have busy schedules  and want to self check up for their skin problem / disease. Which is helping users to get more information and carry out early prevention for the disease. The app will provide some features such as scan skin images to analyze and symptoms recognition, Initial diagnosis to give basic information about the disease and its symptoms, temporary solutions / passive counters to reduce and minimize the pain and spread of skin diseases and news section to gives user more updates and other information such as guidelines, healthy habits for skin health, new technology and techniques that contribute dermatology and skin care, how to recognizing early / basic symptom of the skin disease, etc.
